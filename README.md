# JoyPi
The Ultimate Raspberry Pi 4 Joy build, Entertainment RIGHT OUT THE BOX

The hardware that has been used for the JoyPi is the basic hardware of a raspberrypi4,
with a Raspberry Pi 4, the official RaspberryPi power supply, a 32GB sd card has been used but a 64GB sd card would be prefferable
and any sort of display(some calibration will be required depending on the display)

None of the software utilised here is personally owned by me, but a majority of it falls under the open source licenses
This is a guide of which softwares had been used and how they had all been placed together and what functions they fulfilled
The RaspiberryPi in the end served multiple purposes which are:-
Retropie(RetroGaming Console), Kodi(Multiple streaming services, such as Primevideo, Disney+Hotstar, SonyLiv, Zee5.), Moonlight game streaming service
and it also served multiple other purposes by utilising docker containers(Bitwarden password hosting)

As of the date of writing this readme file I have still not done all that i wish to do with this,
my goals further include to setup a nextcloud on the pi as well as using it as a NAS.
There are many more projects that I wish to do with this Pi, These have been planned by following online tutorials.
